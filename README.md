## Challenge

1. Add a bar button item that lets users select from a handful of prewritten example scripts, shown using a UIAlertController â€“ at the very least your list should include the example we used in this project.
2. You're already receiving the URL of the site the user is on, so use UserDefaults to save the user's JavaScript for each site. You should convert the URL to a URL object in order to use its host property.
3. For something bigger, let users name their scripts, then select one to load using a UITableView.
